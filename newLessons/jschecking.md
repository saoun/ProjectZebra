# Javascript Basics Check In

Often in programming, you will come across a situation where you're looking at someone else's code and you need to make heads or tails of it (like when we're instructing!). This exercise will gauge your ability to understand code you haven't written!

## Setup

For each question, take a moment to answer without using any code - you can jot down the answer in your notes or in the ANSWER HERE blocks in this markdown file.

Afterwards, feel free to run ` node starter.js ` to see if your answer is correct - you'll need to un-comment each part of ` starter.js ` first.

If you get stuck on something, just move onto the next problem.

## Completion

There are 10 questions - complete each one without using any coding! 

## Question 1

```javascript
var a = 5;
var b = 4;
a = b;
console.log('Question 1: a = ',a);
console.log('Question 1: b = ',b);
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of a and b? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one.

```
ANSWER HERE
```

## Question 2

```javascript
var e = 3;
var f = 9;
var g = e + f;
f = g;
e = 5;
console.log('Question 2: e = ',e);
console.log('Question 2: f = ',f);
console.log('Question 2: g = ',g);
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of e, f, and g? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one.

```
ANSWER HERE
```

## Question 3

```javascript
var weather = "cloudy"
weather === "cloudy"
console.log('Question 3: weather = ',weather);
console.log('Question 3: weather === "cloudy" returns ',weather==="cloudy");
```

What is the difference between the first two statements? Explain your answer.

```

```

## Question 4

```javascript
var x = 2;

if(x === 3) {
  console.log("In Question 4, the sushi is tasty!");
} else if (x > 0) {
  console.log("In Question 4, the sushi is cheap and good for the value");
} else {
  console.log("In Question 4, we couldn't find any sushi!")
}
```

Imagine that you run this code. What sushi-based statement would be the output? Explain your answer.

```

```

## Question 5

```javascript
  var q = "4" + 10;
  console.log("Question 5: q = ",q);
```

What are the two datatypes being added in the definition of ` q `? What would happen here and why?

```
ANSWER HERE
```

## Question 6

```javascript
 var turtles = ["Leonardo", "Raphael", "Michelangelo", "Donatello"];
 console.log('Question 6: turtles[0] = ',turtles[0]);
 console.log('Question 6: turtles[1] = ',turtles[1]);
 console.log('Question 6: turtles[2] = ',turtles[2]);
 console.log('Question 6: turtles[3] = ',turtles[3]);
 console.log('Question 6: turtles[4] = ',turtles[4]);
```

What is the index value of "Michelangelo"?

```
ANSWER HERE
```

## Question 7

```javascript
var turtles = ["Leonardo", "Raphael", "Michelangelo", "Donatello"]

for(i = 0; i < 2; i++){
  console.log('Question 7: turtles[' + i + '] = ',turtles[i]);
}
```

* Examine the above code and imagine that you run it.
* What do you expect the outcome will be? Explain your answer.
* Would you make any changes to this code?

```
ANSWER HERE
```

## Question 8

```javascript
var turtles = ["Leonardo", "Raphael", "Michelangelo", "Donatello"]

 turtles.forEach(function(turtle) {
   console.log("Question 8:", turtle + "!");
 });
```

 * Examine the above code and imagine that you run it.
 * What do you expect the outcome will be? Explain your answer.
 * Why would you use a forEach loop instead of the for loop in question 7?

## Question 9

```javascript
var turtles = {};

turtles.names = ["Leonardo", "Raphael", "Michelangelo", "Donatello"];
turtles.group = "Ninga Turtles";

turtles.message = turtles.names.map(function(turtle) {
  return turtle + " is one of the " + turtles.group;
})

console.log("Question 9:", turtles.names);
console.log("Question 9:", turtles.message);

```

* Examine the above code and imagine that you run it.
* What do you expect the outcome will be? Explain your answer.
* What is different between .forEach and .map? When would you want to use .map?

## Question 10
``` javascript
var turtles = {
  leonardo = {
    name: "Leonardo",
    color: "blue",
    weapon: "katanas",
    named_after: "Leonardo da Vinci"
  }
}

turtles.donatello = {};
turtles.donatello.name= "Donatello";
turtles.donatello.color= "purple";
turtles.donatello.weapon= "staff";
turtles.donatello.named_after= "Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi";

turtles["raphael"] = {};
turtles["raphael"]["name"] = "Raphael";
turtles["raphael"]["color"] = "red";
turtles["raphael"]["weapon "]= "twin sai";
turtles["raphael"]["named_after"] = "Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino";

console.log("Question 10":, turtles.raphael.name);
console.log("Question 10:", turtles["donatello"]);
console.log("Question 10:", turtles)
```

* What will be the output of the console.logs?
* How would you console.log who Donatello is named after?
* Which character in the turtle object was created using bracket notation? What is the difference between dot and bracket notation?
* How would you add Michelangelo to the turtles object? Give him the color orange, nunchucks for weapon, and note that he is named after Michelangelo Buonarroti.
